MyInfo verification is optional and we can remove the verification and all the associated data that you have previously shared with us. Once removed, you might have to do so through the same process. 
So long you wish to purchase alcohol in-store, verifying your age through NRIC is still required by customers. 
In order for senior citizens to be entitled for Merdeka Generation/Pioneer Generation/Senior discounts, physical verfication is required by our staff at our physical stores.
","Is MyInfo verification compulsory?
MyInfo verification in your account is optional.

 
Can I remove my verification after verifying it? If so, how to remove it?
You can contact our customer service (tel: 6380 5858) to remove the verification and all the associated data that you have previously shared with us. Once removed, and if you wish to enjoy the benefits of verification again, you might do so through the same process.

If I am purchasing alcohol in-store, and I have verified my age through MyInfo, do I still need to approach our staff to verify through NRIC?
Yes. Having your age verified through MyInfo does not necessarily mean the linked account belongs to you. We are working to introduce a biometrics feature with your phone to easily identify you as a valued customer, so with this new feature, we are able to skip the staff verification step for you.

78,Orders & Payment,Orders Service Fee Structure,"While the surge in visits to our online platform has stabilised, the ongoing pandemic continues to place heavy demands on our existing grocery infrastructure.

We have intensified our efforts in allowing more customers to order their groceries online. We invested heavily in upgrading our infrastructure and training about 150 new staff to become skilled pickers and packers. This resulted in an increase of 25% in the number of delivery slots available for online customers. We will continue to hire more staff and also further increase our online capacity, among various other activities.

We adopt a transparent pricing approach - there are no hidden mark-ups on products themselves as we maintain uniform prices with our brick-and-mortar stores. The service fee partially covers only part of the total costs of processing, picking and packing online grocery orders.

Beyond this, a multi-tiered delivery fee structure was also introduced to provide more flexibility for shoppers to vary their basket sizes and optimise savings for their online purchases. This has made shopping online for groceries accessible to more households and complements the current extensive footprint of our brick-and-mortar stores. The multi-tiered delivery fee structure for our online platform is as follows:

 

Order value (SGD)       

Delivery charge (SGD)

$79 and above

Delivery charge waived

Between $59 to $79
